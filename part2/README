Assignment - 2 - Part 2

Instructions to run a program on target:
Connect pins on galileo board and same input to be given. You can collect multiple sensors with different echo and trigger pins.

file name script.sh is a script to run the code using sysfs.

main file is kept for reference which is generated as platform_test.

To connect galileo board using putty:
i. type in host - sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
ii. connect it through putty - with settings /dev/ttyUSB0 with speed 115200
iii. set IP as 192.168.0.5

To make for galileo:
Go to the folder and do make all

Note: program is warning and error free
Remove previously loaded modules

To copy the program to target(galileo):
scp platform_driver.ko  root@192.168.0.5:/home/root
scp platform_device.ko root@192.168.0.5:/home/root
scp script.sh root@192.168.0.5:/home/root
scp platform_test root@192.168.0.5:/home/root

To run the program:
1. Run the script with argument (number of devices required)

eg. for 2 device
./script.sh 2


or you can load module by using below
insmod platform_driver.ko Number_Of_Devices=2

This script loads the new platform driver and platform devices.

2. Run platform_test with argument (number of devices required)

eg, for 2 device
./platform_test 2

both would ask for echo and trigger pins for HCSRs and it prints below result.

Result while running script for sysfs:


Result while running main program:
Resu lt in user space: (for 2 devices) (you can see that using ssh root@192.168.0.5)

Enter IO pin for trigger hcsr0 
0
Enter IO pin for echo hcsr0 
1
Enter the number of samples per measurement hcsr0 
7
Enter the sampling period hcsr0 
900
Enter IO pin for trigger hcsr1 
2
Enter IO pin for echo hcsr1 
3
Enter the number of samples per measurement hcsr1 
7
Enter the sampling period hcsr1 
900
hcsr1 device is opened
hcsr0 device is opened
distance is 8 (cm) time stamp is 180493060927 for HCSR0
distance is 9 (cm) time stamp is 180532951900 for HCSR1

Kernel prints all info about step wise execution in HCSR devices. (you can observe all kernel logs in putty or screen using dmesg)
Make file is modified for X86 architecture by giving relevant compiler paths and also PATH_variable.

Observations and working:

Platform drivers and devices are craeted, sysfs is enabled and values for pins and are taken and stored in sysfs.

pins are configured as per user inputs for multiple devices.
main program writes and reads on HCSR devices simultaneously using pthreads.
driver program calculates the average distance and returns the oldest value from the buffer.

Distance is calculated as below.
distance = (pulse width * Ultrasonic spreading velocity in air) / 2

Where,  Pulse Width = difference in system ticks , generated at start time and stop time
	1 tick = 1/400MHz(Frequency of Intel Galileo board)
	1 tick = 0.25 * 10^-8 sec
	distance = (diff in ticks)* 0.25*10^-8 * 340 (m/sec) / 2
